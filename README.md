<h3>
What is it?
</h3>
This software converts midi signals into commands that can be understood by the Piano Rooms Roblox game, these commands are simply raw text of the type of command, the channel, and the velocity encoded as numpad keys.
<h3>
Installation
</h3>
<h4>
[Windows]<br>
</h4>
In the root folder there is a standalone executable called MidiConnect.exe
<br>
Double click the executable to run it
<br>
<h4>
[Linux]<br>
</h4>
In the root folder there is a standalone executable called MidiConnectLinux<br>
Using a terminal, give it execution permissions then run it.

```bash
chmod +x MidiConnectLinux
 ./MidiConnectLinux
```
<h4>
[macOS]<br>
</h4>
First, navigate to macOS preferences:<br>
System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy (tab) -> Accessibility (section).
<br>
Find and make sure that **terminal** has a check(If you don't do this step correctly, then the program won't be able to send any keys to Roblox)

In the root folder there is a standalone executable called MidiConnectMac<br>
Using a terminal, give it execution permissions then run it.

```bash
chmod +x MidiConnectMac
 ./MidiConnectMac
```
<br>
<h3>
Compiling from source
</h3>
Don't trust me? I wouldn't either. If you are inclined that way, the Python source code is available in the MidiConnectSource folder. 
<br><br>
Before attempting to run it from its source code, make sure to install the dependencies by executing the
following in the MidiConnectSource directory

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If no errors occur, you could then attempt running main.py and it should work flawlessly
```bash
python main.py
```

Message me @lordhenryvonhenry if you need help getting it to run.
